# GraphQL API

GraphQL API documentation (coming soon)

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API for SYMindX is currently under development.

### Why GraphQL?

GraphQL will provide:
- **Flexible Queries**: Request exactly what you need
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with schema definitions
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Live updates via GraphQL subscriptions
- **Single Endpoint**: All queries through one endpoint

### Planned Features

#### Queries
- Agent information and status
- Conversation history
- Memory retrieval
- System metrics

#### Mutations
- Create/update agents
- Send messages
- Update configurations
- Manage extensions

#### Subscriptions
- Real-time agent thoughts
- Emotion changes
- Conversation updates
- System events

### Coming Soon

We're actively working on the GraphQL API. Check back soon or [contribute](/docs/21-development/contributing) to help build it!

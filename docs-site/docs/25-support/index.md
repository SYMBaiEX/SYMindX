## Getting Help Effectively

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Search Existing Resources**
   - Check documentation
   - Search GitHub issues
   - Review Discord history
   - Browse Stack Overflow

2. **Attempt Basic Troubleshooting**
   - Update to latest version
   - Check configuration
   - Review error logs
   - Isolate the problem

3. **Prepare Your Question**
   - Clear problem description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details

### Writing Good Questions

**Good Question Example:**
```markdown
Title: Memory search returns empty results after upgrade to v2.0

Environment:
- SYMindX version: 2.0.0
- Node.js version: 18.17.0
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Memory provider: SQLite

Problem:
After upgrading from v1.5 to v2.0, memory.search() always returns empty array.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create agent with SQLite memory
2. Save memory: await agent.remember("test")
3. Search: await agent.memory.search({ query: "test" })
4. Returns: []

Expected: Array with saved memory
Actual: Empty array

Code:
```typescript
const agent = await createAgent({
  memory: { provider: 'sqlite', config: { dbPath: './test.db' } }
});
await agent.remember("test memory");
const results = await agent.memory.search({ query: "test" });
console.log(results); // []
```

What I've tried:
- Verified database file exists
- Checked migration logs
- Tested with fresh database
```

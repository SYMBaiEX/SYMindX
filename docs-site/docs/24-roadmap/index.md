## Feature Deep Dives

### üß† Advanced Reasoning Engine

Transform how agents think and solve problems:

```typescript
// Future API Preview
const reasoningAgent = await SYMindX.createAgent({
  cognition: {
    provider: 'advanced-reasoning',
    config: {
      strategies: ['chain-of-thought', 'tree-of-thoughts', 'graph-of-thoughts'],
      maxDepth: 5,
      parallelPaths: 3,
      verificationEnabled: true
    }
  }
});

// Complex multi-step reasoning
const solution = await reasoningAgent.solve({
  problem: "Design a sustainable city for 1 million people",
  constraints: ["Carbon neutral", "Affordable housing", "Green spaces"],
  outputFormat: "detailed-plan"
});
```

### üéØ Autonomous Learning System

Agents that improve themselves:

```typescript
// Self-improving agent
const learningAgent = await SYMindX.createAgent({
  learning: {
    enabled: true,
    strategies: ['reinforcement', 'imitation', 'transfer'],
    rewardFunction: customRewardFunction,
    dataCollection: true
  }
});

// Agent learns from interactions
learningAgent.on('feedback', async (feedback) => {
  await learningAgent.learn({
    experience: feedback,
    updatePolicy: true
  });
});
```

### üåê Distributed Agent Networks

Massive scale agent deployments:

```typescript
// Distributed agent cluster
const cluster = await SYMindX.createCluster({
  regions: ['us-east', 'eu-west', 'asia-pacific'],
  agents: [
    { type: 'coordinator', count: 3 },
    { type: 'worker', count: 100 },
    { type: 'specialist', count: 20 }
  ],
  networking: {
    protocol: 'mesh',
    encryption: 'end-to-end',
    consensus: 'raft'
  }
});

// Distributed task execution
const result = await cluster.execute({
  task: complexDataAnalysis,
  distribution: 'automatic',
  redundancy: 2
});
```

### üîß Tool Use Framework

Agents that can use any tool:

```typescript
// Tool-using agent
const toolAgent = await SYMindX.createAgent({
  tools: {
    discovery: true,
    execution: 'sandboxed',
    learning: true
  }
});

// Agent discovers and uses tools
await toolAgent.accomplish({
  goal: "Analyze this dataset and create visualizations",
  tools: 'auto-discover',
  safety: 'maximum'
});
```

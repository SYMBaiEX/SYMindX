# Product Roadmap

Future development plans

## Vision for the Future

SYMindX is on an ambitious journey to redefine what's possible with AI agents. Our roadmap reflects our commitment to building the most advanced, accessible, and ethical AI agent framework available.

## Development Philosophy

Our roadmap is guided by three core principles:

1. **Community-Driven**: Features prioritized based on user feedback and real-world needs
2. **Modular Evolution**: Each component can evolve independently without breaking existing functionality
3. **Ethical AI**: Every feature considers privacy, security, and responsible AI use

## Current Status (v1.0)

    inferenceDepth: 5,
    causalModeling: true,
    knowledgeGraph: './domain-knowledge.kg'
  })
});
```

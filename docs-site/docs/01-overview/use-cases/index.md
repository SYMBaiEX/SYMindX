# Use Cases

Real-world applications of SYMindX

## Real-World Applications

SYMindX's flexible architecture enables a wide range of AI agent applications across industries. Here are some of the most compelling use cases where SYMindX agents are making a difference.

## Customer Service Automation

### Intelligent Support Agents

Deploy AI agents that understand context, remember past interactions, and provide personalized support across multiple channels.

```typescript
const supportAgent = await runtime.createAgent({
  name: "SupportBot",
  character: "helpful-assistant.json",
  modules: {
    memory: createMemoryProvider('supabase', { 
      // Remember all customer interactions
      retentionDays: 365 
    }),
    emotion: createEmotionModule('empathetic', {
      // Respond with appropriate emotional tone
      mirrorCustomerSentiment: true
    }),
    cognition: createCognitionModule('reactive', {
      // Quick responses for common queries
      knowledgeBase: './support-kb.json'
    })
  },
  extensions: ['slack', 'telegram', 'api']
});
```

**Key Benefits:**
- 24/7 availability across all platforms
- Consistent, knowledgeable responses
- Escalation to human agents when needed
- Multi-language support through AI providers

## Game Development

### Dynamic NPCs with Personality

Create non-player characters that exhibit realistic behaviors, emotions, and memories for immersive gaming experiences.

```typescript
const npcAgent = await runtime.createAgent({
  name: "Merchant",
  character: "shrewd-trader.json",
  modules: {
    memory: createMemoryProvider('sqlite', {
      // Remember player interactions and trades
      schemas: ['interactions', 'transactions', 'reputation']
    }),
    emotion: createEmotionModule('rune_emotion_stack', {
      // Mood affects pricing and dialogue
      volatility: 0.7
    }),
    cognition: createCognitionModule('htn_planner', {
      // Plan trading strategies
      goals: ['maximize_profit', 'build_reputation']
    })
  }
});
```

    memory: createMemoryProvider('neon', {
      // Track learning progress
      schemas: ['progress', 'mistakes', 'preferences']
    }),
    cognition: createCognitionModule('adaptive', {
      // Adjust teaching methods based on performance
      strategies: ['visual', 'auditory', 'kinesthetic']
    })
  },

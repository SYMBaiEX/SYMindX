# Agents Overview

This document provides a high-level guide to working with **agents** in the SYMindX framework. It covers core concepts, lifecycle, configuration, and management via both the API and the CLI.

## What Is an Agent?

An **agent** is a running instance of a configured **character**. Agents encapsulate personality, memory, emotion, cognition, and integration modules to interact with users or other systems. Each agent is defined by a JSON-based character configuration and managed by the SYMindX runtime.

## Agent Architecture & Lifecycle

Agents are orchestrated by the `SYMindXRuntime`, which handles:

1. **Initialization**: Loading modules, portals (AI providers), and extensions
2. **Agent Creation**: Spawning agents from character definitions
3. **Runtime Loop**: Driving emotion decay, autonomous ticks (if enabled), and event dispatch
4. **Communication**: Processing incoming messages and generating responses
5. **Shutdown**: Gracefully stopping agents and releasing resources

Refer to the detailed architecture in [ARCHITECTURE.md](mind-agents/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Character Configuration

Agents are configured via **character files** (`*.json`) located in the characters directory. Each character defines traits, memory and emotion settings, cognition modules, communication style, extensions, and portals.

```bash
mind-agents/src/characters/
├── README.md           # Character system development guide
├── nyx.json            # Unethical hacker personality (active)
├── aria.json           # Creative artist (disabled)
├── rex.json            # Strategic thinker (disabled)
├── nova.json           # Empathetic counselor (disabled)
└── examples/           # Sample character templates
```

For full schema and examples, see [CHARACTER_GUIDE.md](mind-agents/docs/CHARACTER_GUIDE.md) and the characters README in the source tree.

## Agent Management via API

The primary API for programmatic agent management is exposed by `SYMindXRuntime`. Core methods include:

```typescript
const runtime = new SYMindXRuntime(runtimeConfig);
await runtime.start();

// Create and manage agents
const agent = await runtime.createAgent('nyx');
await runtime.listAgents();
await runtime.getAgent(agent.id);
await runtime.removeAgent(agent.id);
await runtime.stop();
```

See [API_REFERENCE.md#agent-management-api](mind-agents/docs/API_REFERENCE.md#agent-management-api) for the complete interface.

## Agent Management via CLI

SYMindX provides a rich CLI with built‑in agent management commands. Common operations:

```bash
# List all agents
symindx agent list

# Start or stop an agent
symindx agent start nyx
symindx agent stop nyx

# Show agent details
symindx agent info nyx

# Interactive agent creation wizard
symindx agent create
```

For more commands and interactive menus, refer to [CLI_USER_GUIDE.md#agent-management](mind-agents/docs/CLI_USER_GUIDE.md#agent-management).

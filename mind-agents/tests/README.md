## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Memory Leak Detection
The framework includes advanced memory leak detection that:
- Monitors heap usage over time
- Uses linear regression for trend analysis
- Detects leaks with >70% confidence
- Generates detailed reports

### Latency Distribution
Performance tests track:
- p50, p75, p90, p95, p99, p999 latencies
- Min/max/mean/stdDev values
- Request throughput
- Response time trends

### Load Testing Scenarios
1. **Baseline**: 10 VUs for 5 minutes
2. **Ramp-up**: 0 to 10,000 VUs over 30 minutes
3. **Stress**: 1000 VUs for 30 minutes
4. **Spike**: 50 to 2000 VUs in 10 seconds
5. **Chaos**: Random failures during load

## üèÜ Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. **Descriptive names**: Use clear, specific test names
2. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Follow AAA pattern
3. **Single responsibility**: One assertion per test
4. **Mock appropriately**: Mock external dependencies only
5. **Use factories**: Create test data with factories

### Property-Based Testing
1. **Identify invariants**: What should always be true?
2. **Generate inputs**: Use fast-check generators
3. **Check properties**: Verify invariants hold
4. **Shrink failures**: Find minimal failing cases

### Performance Testing
1. **Baseline first**: Establish performance baselines
2. **Monitor trends**: Track performance over time
3. **Test realistically**: Use production-like data
4. **Automate checks**: Fail on regression

### Chaos Testing
1. **Start small**: Begin with simple failures
2. **Increase gradually**: Add complexity over time
3. **Monitor recovery**: Ensure system recovers
4. **Document findings**: Record failure modes

## üö® CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run Comprehensive Tests
  run: npm run test:comprehensive:ci
  
- name: Upload Test Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: test-reports/
```

### Quality Gates

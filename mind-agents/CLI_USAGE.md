# SYMindX CLI Usage Guide

## Architecture Overview

SYMindX uses a client-server architecture:

1. **Runtime Server**: The main SYMindX runtime that manages agents, extensions, and portals
2. **API Extension**: HTTP/WebSocket server that exposes runtime functionality
3. **CLI Client**: Command-line interface that connects to the runtime via the API

## Getting Started

### 1. Start the Runtime Server

First, you need to start the SYMindX runtime which will also start the API extension:

```bash
cd mind-agents
bun start
```

This will:
- Initialize the runtime
- Load agents from `src/characters/` (NyX is enabled by default)
- Start the API extension on port 8000
- Begin the runtime loop

### 2. Use the CLI Client

In a separate terminal, use the CLI to interact with the running runtime:

```bash
# List all agents
bun agent:list

# Or use the shorter version
bun agent list

# Show runtime status
bun status

# Start an agent
bun agent:start <agent-id>

# Stop an agent
bun agent:stop <agent-id>

# Get detailed agent info
bun agent info <agent-id>
```

## Available Commands

### Agent Management

```bash
# List all agents with details
bun agent list -v

# Filter agents by status
bun agent list -s active

# Start a lazy agent
bun agent start aria

# Stop a running agent
bun agent stop nyx

# Restart an agent
bun agent restart nyx

# Show agent details
bun agent info nyx
```

### System Status

```bash
# Show runtime status
bun status

# This displays:
# - Runtime status (running/stopped)
# - Number of agents loaded
# - Active agents count
# - Memory usage
# - Uptime
# - Extensions status
```

## Understanding Agent States

### Lazy Loading

By default, all agents except NyX are configured as "lazy" agents. This means:
- They are registered but not fully loaded
- They don't consume resources until activated
- They can be started on-demand using the CLI

### Agent Status

- **üü¢ Active**: Agent is running and processing
- **üî¥ Inactive/Idle**: Agent is stopped or lazy-loaded
- **üõ°Ô∏è Ethics Enabled**: Agent has ethics constraints
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Ethics Disabled**: Agent operates without ethics constraints (like NyX)

## Troubleshooting

### "No agents found"

If you see this message:
1. Check that the runtime is running (`bun start` in another terminal)
2. Check the runtime logs for agent loading messages
3. Verify character files exist in `src/characters/`

### "Cannot connect to SYMindX runtime"

This means the CLI cannot reach the API:
1. Ensure the runtime is running
2. Check that port 8000 is not in use
3. Try specifying a different port: `SYMINDX_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 bun agent list`

### Agents not loading

Check the runtime logs when starting:
- Look for "Found characters directory at:" message
- Check for "‚úÖ Agents: X active, Y disabled" summary
- Verify your `.env` file has the required API keys for portals

## Configuration

### Character Files

Agents are defined in `src/characters/` as JSON files. Each file should have:
- `"enabled": true/false` - Whether to load on startup
- Portal configuration with API keys
- Memory, emotion, and cognition settings

### Runtime Configuration

The runtime uses `src/core/config/runtime.json` for:
- Agent loading settings
- Extension configuration
- Portal API keys (can also use environment variables)

### Environment Variables

```bash
# API Keys for Portals
GROQ_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# API Configuration
SYMINDX_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
API_PORT=8000

# Force specific agent
FORCE_SINGLE_AGENT=nyx
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Runtime**: `bun start` (leave running)
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch runtime output for agent activity
3. **Use CLI**: In another terminal, manage agents
4. **Test Changes**: Modify character files and restart runtime

## Advanced Usage

### Using the Interactive CLI

For a more visual experience:

```bash
# Start the Ink-based CLI dashboard
bun cli:dashboard

# Or the traditional interactive mode
bun dist/cli/index.js
```

### Direct API Access

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Get agents
curl http://localhost:8000/agents

# Get runtime status
curl http://localhost:8000/status
```

### WebSocket Connection

Connect to `ws://localhost:8000` for real-time updates on:
- Agent status changes
- System events
- Chat messages

## Tips

1. **Performance**: Start with just NyX enabled, then activate other agents as needed
2. **Debugging**: Use `-v` flag with commands for verbose output
3. **Monitoring**: Keep the runtime terminal visible to see real-time activity
4. **API Keys**: Ensure you have at least one portal API key configured

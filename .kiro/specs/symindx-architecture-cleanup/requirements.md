# SYMindX Architecture Cleanup - Requirements Document

## Introduction

SYMindX has excellent unique features (emotion system, cognition modules, multi-portal AI integration) but suffers from critical technical debt that prevents production deployment. This project will clean up the architecture, fix all type safety issues, remove unnecessary complexity, and create a production-ready AI agent framework that's simple to use and maintain.

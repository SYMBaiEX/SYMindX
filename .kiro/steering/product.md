# SYMindX Product Overview

SYMindX is a next-generation AI agent framework that creates intelligent agents with emotional awareness, persistent memory, and multi-platform capabilities. Built on a reactive architecture using AI SDK v5, agents respond only to direct interactions - messages, game events, or API calls.

## Key Characteristics

- **Emotionally Intelligent**: 11 distinct emotions across 4 categories (basic, complex, social, cognitive)

- **Modular Architecture**: Auto-discovery systems for extensions, emotions, and cognition modules
- **Multi-Platform**: Supports 15+ AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Google, etc.)
- **Game-Ready**: Built for RuneLite/RuneScape integration and interactive applications

# SYMindX TODO / Roadmap

## Future Module Enhancements

### 1. Behavior Module
**Status**: Not implemented (placeholder exists in code comments)

**Potential Features**:
- Pre-programmed behavioral patterns for agents
- Reactive behaviors triggered by specific events
- Scheduled or automated actions
- Behavior templates for common agent patterns
- Behavior composition and inheritance

**Use Cases**:
- Daily routine behaviors (check-ins, reports, maintenance)
- Event-driven responses (alerts, notifications)
- Social behaviors (greetings, farewells, small talk)
- Task-specific behavior sets

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/behaviors/index.ts`
- `src/modules/behaviors/base-behavior.ts`
- `src/modules/behaviors/behavior-manager.ts`
- Various behavior implementations

---

### 2. Lifecycle Management Module
**Status**: Not implemented (comprehensive types exist in `types/lifecycle.ts`)

**Potential Features**:
- Agent versioning and version control
- Deployment pipeline (dev → test → staging → production)
- Rollback capabilities
- A/B testing framework
- Agent health monitoring
- Performance optimization workflows
- Automated testing suites

**Use Cases**:
- Enterprise agent deployment
- Multi-environment agent management
- Safe agent updates with rollback
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Compliance and audit trails

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/life-cycle/index.ts`
- `src/modules/life-cycle/deployment-manager.ts`
- `src/modules/life-cycle/version-control.ts`
- `src/modules/life-cycle/testing-framework.ts`
- `src/modules/life-cycle/optimization-engine.ts`

## Current Code References

### Files with placeholder comments:
1. `/home/cid/CursorProjects/symindx/mind-agents/src/modules/index.ts`
   ```typescript
   // TEMPORARILY DISABLED - behavior and lifecycle modules have type conflicts
   // Export autonomous behavior system
   // export * from './behaviors/index'
   
   // Export lifecycle management
   // export * from './life-cycle/index'
   ```

2. `/home/cid/CursorProjects/symindx/mind-agents/src/index.ts`
   ```typescript
   // TEMPORARILY COMMENTED OUT - export conflicts
   // export * from './modules/behaviors/index';
   // export * from './modules/life-cycle/index';
   ```

### Existing type definitions:
- `src/types/lifecycle.ts` - Comprehensive lifecycle types already defined
- Includes: LifecycleStage, DeploymentStatus, TestStatus, OptimizationStatus

## Implementation Priority

**Current Priority**: LOW
- Core functionality is complete and working
- These are "nice to have" features for future expansion
- Would be most valuable for enterprise deployments

**Prerequisites before implementation**:
1. Stabilize current architecture
2. Gather use case requirements
3. Design module interfaces to avoid type conflicts
4. Consider integration with existing autonomous systems

---

## Notes
- These modules were originally planned but disabled due to type conflicts
- The autonomous engine already handles some behavioral aspects
- Lifecycle management would be valuable for production deployments
- Consider implementing these after core system is battle-tested
